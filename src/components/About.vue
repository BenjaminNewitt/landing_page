        I am a full stack Software developer who enjoys working on a variety of
        projects. Versatility and adaptability are skills I initially developed
        working in a wide variety of roles in retail for the past few years, and
        now that I've transitioned into the exciting industry of software
        development, I've been able to further reinforce those skills.
        <br />
        <br />Coupling those soft skills (alongside focusing on teamwork and
        collaboration) with industry-specific skills, I'm enjoying entering into
        a new career field. Working with a handful of languages including C#,
        JavaScript, as well as frameworks such as Node.js and Vue, has taught me
        I'm also able to adapt to different virtual environments —and how to
        appreciate it.
